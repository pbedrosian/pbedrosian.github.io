Well well well, I guess the time has come for blog number two. As I am pretty much done with learning Ruby, what words or wisdom can I offer? I guess there are a few things that I can offer to those looking to start out in their codig adventures. 

1) Take your time -- Coding is all brand new and the things you are learning are not as complicated as you'd think. If you take your time and review the infomatin slowly, you will find thay it begins to make sence. Ruby was made to understand.

2) Read, read, and read some more. There are so many great books out there to read that will supliment what you're working on in the program. I recommend "Learning Ruby the Hard Way". 

3) Take a break. You will find that you feel overlwellmed with the material and not sure if you'll ever understand, but it is importent to take a step back, turn off the computer, and breathe. Clearing the mind will help work harder. 


There it is. Not much say as my brain is still a little fried, but these are three things that have helped me so far and I hope they help you too!
