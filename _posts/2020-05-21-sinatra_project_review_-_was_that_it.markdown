If you would have asked me how I felt about seeing the seoncd project come up only 4 weeks or so away from the first project, I would have said how upsetting it was. As I did not feel like I was going to be able to prepare, retain, and work ahead. Boy, was I wrong.  Although it did off a little rocky (Advanced SQL queries are something else) it did end up much better than I thought. With the introduction of ActiveRecord, all started to click and so did my Siatra Project. 

## My Project:

Although it did take sme time for me to come up with this I do feel good about the outcome. I build a database for user to store information on vistied national parks. Users can create an account, add park info, edit, and delete the info. Full CRUD. 

In the app, users are able to upload data and notes about their visit and store them, then view all their submissons.  Overall, there didn't seem to be much issue with this project. I believe the biggest help was visally connecting the controller with their views. Once I did that, my routes and verbs seem to match up with ease.

I ended up with three different controllers and a few different models. Each route included user validation for not only checking if a user was logged in, but also to verify that they own the differnt submissions requested. Users could only see and edit their submission

## What I learned:

Well, to say this was an easy project would not be accureate, but it was easier than expected. I believe that taking time to map out the route with each view, reviewng in a pry session often, and not getting disocutages if the best way to tackle a new project. Although this one is done, it is far from complete. I will be continually wotking on improvements that will make it even better.
